C++ assignments from Programming Fundamentals II class


Assignment 1 - Expression Review

Checkbook 1.0 - Write a C++ program to help you balance your checkbook at the end of the month.
    Upon successful completion of competency 1.2, the student will be able to:
    1. Write code that uses selection control structures (if and switch)
    2. Write code that uses repetition control structures (while, do-while, and for)

Checkbook Balancing Revisited - 
    Upon successful completion, the student will be able to:
    1. Modularize a program by coding functions to perform individual tasks
    2. Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of local and global variables by
    making appropriate choices in declaring variables
    3. Demonstrate an understanding of parameter passing including pass-by-value
    and pass-by-reference
    4. Demonstrate an understanding of function overloading
    
Date Class -- Design, code and test programs that contain programmer-defined data types (classes)
    Upon successful completion of competency 1.4, the student will be able to:
    1. Demonstrate the concept of encapsulation by creating classes with data and function members
    2. Make appropriate use of access specifiers for data and function members (private and public)
    3. Use constructor functions for object initialization
    4. Demonstrate the concept of data abstraction by separating the class
    specification from the class implementation

Payroll Version 1.0: Design, code and test programs that use arrays and structures (arrays of structures).
    Upon successful completion of competency 2.1, the student will be able to:
    1. Demonstrate an understanding of structures by writing programs that use C structs.
    2. Demonstrate the ability to process larger amounts of data by using one-dimensional arrays where appropriate.
    3. Demonstrate how one-dimensional arrays are passed to functions in C++.
    4. Demonstrate the ability to integrate the concepts of objects and arrays by
    writing programs that use arrays of objects.
    
Monkey Food: Design, code and test programs that use two-dimensional arrays
    Upon successful completion of competency 2.2, the student will be able to:
    1. Demonstrate the ability to process data containing multiple sets of identical data using two-dimensional arrays
    2. Demonstrate how two-dimensional arrays are passed to functions in C++.
    

Postal Packages: Design, code and test programs that use arrays and sequential search
    Upon successful completion of competency 2.3, the student will be able to:
    1. Demonstrate an understanding of array searching including the sequential (linear) search and binary search algorithm.
    2. Demonstrate an understanding of array sorting including variations on the bubble sort algorithm.
    
Test Scores 2: Design, code and test programs that use pointers, dynamically-allocated arrays and sorting
    Upon successful completion of competency 3.1, the student will be able to:
    1. Demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between arrays and pointers in C++ by writing code to access array elements using pointers.
    2. Choose between using a pointer to a variable or a pointer to a constant.
    3. Demonstrate a thorough understanding of dynamic memory allocation by
    writing code to dynamically allocate arrays.
    
Payroll Version 2.0: Design, code and test programs that use C++ strings and input and output files
    Upon successful completion of competency 3.2, the student will be able to:
    1. Describe how the object that invokes a member function is passed to that function
    2. Specify that a member function should not modify the object that invokes it
    3. Describe how an object is assigned to another object
    4. Demonstrate an understanding of the differences between C-strings (character
    arrays) and the C++ string class object
    5. Demonstrate how to perform basic operations (input, output, assignment,
    comparisons, etc.) on character, C-string, and C++ string data
    6. Demonstrate an understanding of file input and output by developing a program
    uses file input and output
    
Payroll Version 3.0: Design, code and test programs that use C strings
    Upon successful completion of competency 3.3, the student will be able to:
    1. Demonstrate how to read data from a file with an unknown amount of data 2. Explain how recursive functions work
    3. Explain how linked-lists work
